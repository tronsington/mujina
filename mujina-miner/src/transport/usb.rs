//! USB transport implementation.
//!
//! This module handles USB device discovery and hotplug events using
//! the nusb crate for cross-platform support. It provides raw device
//! information without any knowledge of what the devices are or how
//! they should be configured.
//!
//! ## Platform Support
//!
//! - **Linux**: nusb (enumeration/hotplug) + udev (serial port lookup)
//! - **macOS**: nusb (enumeration/hotplug) + IOKit (serial port lookup)

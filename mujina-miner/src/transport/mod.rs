//! Physical transport layer for board connections.
//!
//! This module handles discovery of mining boards across different
//! physical transports (USB, PCIe, Ethernet, etc). Each transport
//! implementation provides device discovery and emits transport-specific
//! events when devices are connected or disconnected.
